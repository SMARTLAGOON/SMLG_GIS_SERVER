# SMARTLAGOON GIS server <img src="src/readme/logo.png" align="right" width="200" />

## Description

The EU H2020 SMARTLAGOON project requires the review and adaptation of publicly available information, most of which correspond with georeferenced data. In such a context, we have implemented a GeoServer to gather and consult the data and an OpenLayers fronted to show them in a Web repository.

## Why GeoServer

GeoServer is an open-source server written in Java – allowing users to share and edit geospatial data. Designed for interoperability, it publishes data from all major spatial data sources using open standards.
GeoServer is an ideal system for sharing spatial information with stakeholders as it has numerous advantages:

* By implementing the Web Map Service (WMS) standard, GeoServer can create maps in a variety of output formats.
* OpenLayers, a free mapping library, makes map generation fast and easy.
* It is based on GeoTools, an open-source Java GIS toolkit.
* GeoServer conforms to the Web Feature Service (WFS) and Web Coverage Service (WCS) standards, which allow sharing and editing of the data used to generate maps.
* It uses the Web Map Tile Service standard to tile published maps for easy use by mobile and web mapping applications.
* It is a modular application to which additional functions are added through extensions.
* It allows for the future incorporation of open data into websites and applications, freeing it for the public and allowing for greater transparency.
